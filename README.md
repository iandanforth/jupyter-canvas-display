# jupyter-canvas-display
Example notebook for live updating canvas via Jupyter widgets.

If you've ever wanted to use JavaScript to visualize values of a running
Python cell in a Jupyter notebook this example is for you!

In the notebook you'll learn about Jupyter Widgets and how to set them up so
that a value changed in Python updates a visualization drawn to a canvas
element using fabric.js. Hopefully this will be a useful starting point for
your own projects!
